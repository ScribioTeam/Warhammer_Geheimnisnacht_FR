fearfrost;Fearfrost;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fearfrost_desc;Magically forged by Khan-Queen Miska, this sword is imbued with powerful ice magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_QUEEN_0;The Khan-Queen's Sword;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_QUEEN_0;This blade has been passed down through the ages from Tzarina to Tzarina, Mother to daughter, since Miska gave it to her daughter Shoika. In keeping with this time honored tradition, the blade is now yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_QUEEN_0;May my enemies fall as Miska's did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##The Erengrad Republic
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_0;Rebellious Erengrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_0;The important trade city of Erengrad rebelled against their suzerain ruler in Kislev durning the civil war during the succession crisis several decades ago. While they have made no claims of being above the [Root.GetTitle], they have set a dangerous precedent for other would-be secessionists. Their continued refusal to submit willingly has only served to inflame tensions.\n\nWhile we are justified in launching a punitive expidition, the burghers may yet convince us to accept their pretense of self-rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_0;The rebellious burghers have defied my will for too long!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ERENGRAD_0;Their coin could make a very convincing argument.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##What to do with the Veche
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_1;Fate of the Erengrad Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_1;The center of Republican rule in Erengrad has long been its Veche, the seat of their burgher republic. As a powerful symbol of their popular rule, and the administrative heart of their republic, destroying it will break their will and discourage any further discussion of self-rule. However, allowing them to retain it will be seen as a gesture of the [Root.GetTitle]'s mercy, and will do much to cement their loyalty to the [Root.GetTitle] in Kislev.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_1;The Veche burns. Their defiance cannot go unpunished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ERENGRAD_1;The Veche shall remain at the pleasure of the [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##The Tzar/Tzarina demands a bribe
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_2;The Kislevite Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_2;The ignoble sovereign in Kislev has given us the option to pay a bribe or risk their might. While there is reason to believe that such threats are baseless posturing, a refusal still risks the independence of our Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_2;Our continued independence is worth a few coins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ERENGRAD_2;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##Bribe recieved
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_3;Threats Pay Off;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_3;The burghers of Erengrad have agreed to pay us a hefty sum to ensure that they remain independent. While they are certainly not happy about being forced to part with any coin, our threat of our invasion no longer stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_3;I made them an offer they couldn't refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##Threats rebuffed
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_4;Erengrad Unmoved;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_4;The arrogant burghers of Erengrad have foolishly denied your just demand. In response to your most humble request, the patricians of the city have replied only with insults and affronts to your dignity as their rightful suzerain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_4;Their folly will soon be made clear to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Kislev melting pot
U_EVTDESC55002;For a long time we Gospodars ruled here and we shed our blood with other people of these lands. The time has come to unite with them and create new great Kislev!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTOPTA55002;Let there be one nation, one people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTDESC55003;Gospodars, Ungols and other people of Kislev once divided are now creating family bonds and adopting new identity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTOPTA55003;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTDESC55004;More and more people in Kislev are adopting new identity. Some of courtiers also embraced new ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTOPTA55004;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTDESC55005;Whole realm has adopted new Kislevarin. My servants inform me that it is increasingly popular to show new customs and speak new Kislevarin amongst Ungol and Gospodar Boyars and Szlachta...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTOPTA55005;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTDESC55006;My wise liege has persuaded me to adopt new customs and new identity - I am not Gospodar or Ungol now I've become Kislevite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTOPTA55006;It was about time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# namespace = wardrobe;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCwardrobe.0;You've grown restless these past few weeks and once again find yourself unable to sleep, pacing in circles about your room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.0;Perhaps I should explore the castle a little?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.1;You begin to wander the twisting halls of the castle, exploring the occasional room, finding little of note. But in one room you notice a large wardrobe hidden in the shadows, strangely you cant help but feel a sense of malice eminating from the thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.1A;Its getting late... I should get back to my room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.1B;Where did this come from?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.101;Without taking your eyes off the wardrobe you back out of the room, only after its out of sight do you turn around and sprint back to your quarters. Slamming the door behind you and leaping into your bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.101;Close your eyes and get some sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.102;You move cautiously closer to the wardrobe to investigate, it resonates with an icy chill and elaborate motifs of snowy forests and frozen rivers are carved into the wood and iron. Its truly beautiful, you feel as if you cant look away and reach a hand out to touch it, before you realize what you've done you've opened the door and crawled inside the door shutting itself firmly behind you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.102;How deep is this thing?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.2;Suddenly, you stumble out of the back of the wardrobe, the first thing you notice isn't the trees, or the freshly fallen snow its the biting unbearable cold. Your teeth chatter as you bundle yourself in some old furs from the wardrobe and head down a nearby path. Its not long before you come upon a fork... Which way now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.2A;Take the left fork.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.2B;Take the right fork.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.201;After wandering down the path for what seems like hours, your fingers and toes begin to feel numb from the cold and you begin to think longingly of the warm bed waiting in your quarters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.201;I've been here far too long, time to get home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.3;After wandering down the path for several minutes you stumble into a small clearing densly packed with ruined buildings clustered around a small well, as you wander towards the center of what you presume is an abandoned town you feel an ominous presence directly around the next corner, an overwhelming sense of dread fills your very bones as you catch a glimpse of a terrible beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.3A;Make a run for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.3B;Hide! Quick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.301;Without a moments hesitation you turn around and sprint in the direction of the wardrobe. When your just a few feet away you glance back but whatever it was chose not to follow you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.301;Quickly climb back inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPwardrobe.301;making it back safely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.302;The beast notices you immediatly and sinks a serrated claw into your thigh as you try to escape, dragging you towards its jagged maw. You managed to kick free of the beast and struggle to your feet, adrenaline fills your veins as you stumble to the wardrobe and crawl inside thankful that thing didn't chase after you. You emerge and collapse to the floor covered in blood, the wardobe slowly merges with the wall behind you as you call out for help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.302;Help! I'm hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPwardrobe.302;it seeing you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.303;Without thinking you duck into the nearest doorway and crawl under the remains of what appears to be a bed, after waiting for what felt like hours without making a sound you feel the presence recede and cautiously crawl from your hiding place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.303;Take a look around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPwardrobe.303;going unnoticed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.4;Though the room is dark and covered in decay you know something terrible happened here, you head towards the doorway to leave, before you do you notice a faint purple glow coming from a large gemstone built into the mantle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.4A;Whats this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPwardrobe.4A;Reach out and touch the gemstone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.4B;Leave it where it is and get out of here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.401;As you lay your hand upon the stone it flashes with a blinding purple light and you feel a strange power surge through you! You can't help but exclaim loudly in surprise and elation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.401;Head back to the wardrobe, that thing might have heard you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.5;As you emerge from the hulking wardrobe your struck by a strong naseau and collapse as the room spins around you. It takes several moments to regain your senses, the wardrobe is gone and the sun is shining through the nearby window..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe.5;Was it all a dream?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
